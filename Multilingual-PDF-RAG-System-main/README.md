# Multilingual-PDF-RAG-System
I built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that extracts and processes both scanned and digital PDFs, supporting multiple languages like English, Hindi, Bengali, and Chinese. The system answers questions from PDF content accurately using a combination of semantic and keyword-based retrieval methods.
